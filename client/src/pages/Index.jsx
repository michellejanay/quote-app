        This app was created using <strong>Node.js</strong>,
        <strong>Express.js</strong> for the backend, <br />
        Glitch for <strong>API</strong> data hosting/fetching, <br /> and
        <strong> React.js/React Router</strong> for the Frontend.

      <p>
        This was my first Full Stack app, and I hope you enjoy using it as much
        as I enjoyed creating it.
